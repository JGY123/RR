# RR Refactor Plan — Uniform Feature Flow

**Started:** 2026-05-01 (post-presentation)
**Baseline tag:** `presentation-2026-05-01-shipped` (commit `3b10805`)
**North-star goal:** features ship from one place, not N places.

---

## Why we're doing this

After the May 1 presentation, the user observed that "many tables / cards / tiles don't have all the functionality we spoke about" and asked whether the code could be organized better. The honest answer is yes:

- 6+ table renderers (`rWt`, `rCountryTable`, `rGroupTable`, `rChr`, …) each ~100 lines, each with its own column-picker, filter-chip, sparkline, fullscreen path
- 30+ tiles, each assembling its own chrome (About + Notes + Reset View + Hide + Full Screen + CSV) inline
- Per-tile fullscreen functions (`openSecFullscreen`, `openCtryFullscreen`, …) instead of one generalized opener
- Render functions reading `cs.sectors` / `cs.hold` / `cs.countries` directly, instead of going through the per-week-aware accessors `getDimForWeek` / `getSelectedWeekSum`

Result: when we add a feature, it ships to whatever I touched and stays broken everywhere else. That's the pattern the user is calling out.

## The four abstractions

### 1. `TableSpec` — declarative table definition
Each table declares once: `{ id, data, columns, filterable, sortable, drillFn, csvName, fullscreen }`. One renderer (`renderTable(spec)`) produces HTML. One filter panel (`tableFilterPanel(spec)`) produces column-hide/show controls. Every table behaves identically.

### 2. `tileChrome({…})` — single source of truth for buttons
Replaces inline assembly of About / Notes / Reset View / Hide / Full Screen / CSV / View Toggle in every card. Add a button → it ships everywhere.

### 3. `getDimForWeek` enforcement
Already exists. Add a render-time linter that warns when a renderer reads `cs.sectors` / `cs.hold` / `cs.countries` directly instead of going through the accessor. Catches "forgot to swap" leaks before they ship.

### 4. `OpenFullscreen(tileId, opts)` — uniform fullscreen
Each tile registers `{ preserveCurrentView, richFeatures }`. Country gets Map / Heat / Chart / Table tabs. Sector gets KPI summary tiles above the table.

---

## Phase plan + checkpoints

**Updated 2026-05-01 14:00 — pivoted to lower-risk approach.** Audit revealed every existing renderer (`rWt`, `rCountryTable`, `rGroupTable`, `rChr`, `rAttribTable`) already emits `data-col="X"` on `<th>` and `<td>`. 146 such annotations across the file. That means we can ship **uniform column hide/show via CSS attribute selectors** without rewriting any renderer. This dramatically lowers risk: existing rendering stays exactly as-is, we add a sidecar layer.

| Phase | Scope | Est. | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | Audit — DONE. See `REFACTOR_AUDIT.md`. | — | ✅ |
| **B** | Build `tableColHide` framework: (1) auto-discover columns from rendered DOM via `th[data-col]`, (2) build a sidecar panel listing them as checkboxes, (3) hide via CSS rule `td[data-col="X"], th[data-col="X"] { display:none }`, (4) state persists in `rr.tableColHide.v1`. Apply to cardSectors as canary. | 1 hr | ☐ |
| **C** | Apply `tableColHide` to every table that has `data-col` attrs: cardSectors, cardCountry, cardGroups, cardRegions, cardChars, cardAttrib, cardFacDetail, cardRiskFacTbl. One button placement, identical UX everywhere. | 30 min | ☐ |
| **D** | Build `tileChrome()` contract. Migrate Tier-1 tiles to use it (drops ~800 lines of inline chrome assembly). Then Tier-2/3 sweep. | 2 hrs | ☐ |
| **E** | `openTileFullscreen` improvements: per-tile registration so Country preserves Map view + adds Heat/Chart/Table tabs; Sector adds KPI summary tiles above table. | 2 hrs | ☐ |
| **F** | Universe-selector audit — does "Both" double-count? Report findings before touching code. | 30 min | ☐ |
| **G** | Scroll preservation on `changeWeek` (snapshot scrollY before render, restore after). | 30 min | ☐ |
| **H** | Factor Detail per-week wiring + period selector + scroll-preserving update. | 1 hr | ☐ |
| **I** | Known data bug: Kongsberg false-exit in cardWeekOverWeek (hold_prev shorter than hold — tickers in hold but missing from hold_prev get flagged "exited" wrongly). | 30 min | ☐ |
| **J** | Render-time `console.warn` linter for direct `cs.sectors` / `cs.countries` / `cs.hold` access in render paths. Catches week-flow leaks. | 1 hr | ☐ |
| **K** | Visual polish pass — once architecture is uniform, design polish across tiles. Spacing, typography, color harmony. | 1-2 hrs | ☐ |

**Total: ~13 hrs.** Ships incrementally — each phase is a checkpoint with a working dashboard.

## Ground rules

1. **The working dashboard never breaks.** After each phase: smoke test + visual diff vs `presentation-2026-05-01-shipped`. If anything regresses, fix before moving on.
2. **Tag every checkpoint.** `refactor.YYYYMMDD.HHMM.phase-X-complete` so we can roll back at any point.
3. **No new features during refactor.** Only the migration. New features go in a separate phase after the architecture is solid.
4. **Visual + functional parity first, design polish second.** Don't try to redesign while migrating. Migrate to spec, then a separate pass for design.
5. **Anti-fabrication policy stays sacred.** No new "if X is null compute Y" patches. Per-tile data integrity carries forward.
6. **Smoke test gates every commit.** `node` parse check + `python3` JSON check + sample render of cardSectors / cardCountry / cardWeekOverWeek.

## Status summary (post-2026-05-01 session)

**Shipped:**
- All 8 dashboard tables have uniform "⚙ Cols" hide/show panel (Phase B+C).
- Scroll position preserved on week / period change (Phase G).
- WoW row tooltips disambiguate similarly-named holdings (Phase I).
- Universe selector audited; no bug; UX options proposed (Phase F).
- Factor Detail / Factor Risk Snapshot / Risk-tab factor table all flow per-week (Phase H).
- Country fullscreen — Map view now opens correctly + tabs Map/Heat/Table inside FS (Phase E).
- Static lint prevents future direct-cs.X regressions (Phase J).

**Outstanding:**
- ~~Phase D — `tileChromeStrip()` migration sweep~~ — **COMPLETE 2026-05-04 10:30. All 30 tile chrome rows migrated. Zero inline chrome holdouts.**
- ~~Phase K — design polish~~ — SHIPPED 2026-05-01 19:00–19:35. Tokens + 10 canonical classes + ~40 inline styles eliminated.
- Per-holding factor TE breakdown for historical weeks — data not shipped per-week from FactSet, currently shows "—" with explanation. Would require parser-side per-week per-holding factor_contr extraction (would balloon file size). Deferred to FactSet conversation.
- Phase F UX (combo A+D+E) — SHIPPED 2026-05-01 17:55.
- Item #2A sector full-page summary tiles — SHIPPED 2026-05-01 18:10.
- Item #4 Factor Performance y-axis — SHIPPED 2026-05-01 18:20.

**Next session priorities (ordered by leverage):**
1. **Re-run cardRiskByDim audit** — earlier audit subagent ran for 50+ min and likely stalled. Re-spawn with same brief (deferred 2026-05-04).
2. **Pick 2-3 more Tier-2 tiles for audit sweep** — cardCorr / cardFacContribBars / cardTEStacked / cardBetaHist / cardFacHist haven't been audited recently.
3. **Pending audit fixes from cardWeekOverWeek**:
   - F4: CSV export for move list (small, ship anytime)
   - C1: clarify riskMode neutral vs all-risk coloring on Beta/AS/Holdings deltas (PM decision)
   - D2/D3/D4/D5: typography polish (.section-label adoption, off-scale font sizes, sparkline color convention)
4. **Pending audit fixes from cardHoldRisk**:
   - F2: dedicated `openHoldRiskFullscreen()` handler with bigger bubbles (~25 LOC)
   - D3: bench-only long tail clutter (PM decision: filter or surface)
5. **Drill modal migration** — drill modals (oDr, oDrMetric, oDrCountry, oSt) still have inline chrome.
6. **Spacing scale adoption** — sweep remaining hardcoded `padding: Xpx` to `var(--space-*)` tokens.
7. **End-of-session: commit a "presentation-2026-05-XX" tag whenever we have a stable state** for stakeholder review.

## Wider rollout (post-refactor)

The user said: "we need to start thinking about how to roll it to wider use." After the refactor is done, the architecture will be ready for:

- **Multi-user deployment** — Linux server + nginx + systemd timer. Per-user preferences in localStorage already isolated.
- **Per-firm theming** — CSS variables already drive colors. Add a theme picker.
- **API mode** — switch between FactSet CSV and a future API endpoint by changing one accessor.
- **Onboarding** — declarative TableSpec + TileSpec means a new strategy / new tile is "write a config", not "copy 200 lines of inline JS."

Tracking these in a separate `ROLLOUT.md` post-refactor.
